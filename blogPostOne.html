            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
                The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has erect ears that are in proportion to the equilateral triangle of the head. The breed standard indicates that the ears should be firm, medium in size, and tapered slightly to a rounded point. The head should be "fox-like" in shape and appearance.
            </p>
            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>
                Pembroke Welsh Corgis love to be involved in the family, and tend to follow wherever their owners go. They have a great desire to please their owners, thus making them eager to learn and train. The dogs can also be challenging to train due to their working background, stubbornness and intelligence - they were ranked as the eleventh most intelligent dog in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs. Besides herding, they also function as watchdogs due to their alertness and tendency to bark, which can be aggravated if they are not stimulated adequately. 
            </p>
            <h3>Health</h3>
            <p>
                Pembrokes have an average life expectancy of 12-15 years. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are achondroplastic, meaning they are a "true dwarf" breed.
                As such, their stature and build can lead to certain non-inherited helath conditions, but genetic issues should also be considered.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The Pembroke Welsh Corgi lineage has been traced back as far as 1107 AD. It is said that Flemish weavers brought the dogs with them as they traveled to reside in Wales. Some popular stories give Corgis a creatrion myth connected to fairies.
                One story states that two children were running through a forest and stumbled upon the funeral of a fairy. The mourning fairies gave the two children two small corgi puppies and the children took them home, thus giving the breed popularity.
